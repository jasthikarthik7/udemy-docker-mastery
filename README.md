üßæ Workflow Overview

1Ô∏è‚É£ Trigger
	‚Ä¢	A new high or critical finding is detected from Black Duck or Checkmarx pipelines.
	‚Ä¢	The finding triggers the need for a policy exception (manual or automated ticket creation).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Request Submission (Application Team)
	‚Ä¢	User fills a ServiceNow Exception Request Form with:
	‚Ä¢	Application name
	‚Ä¢	Business owner / contact info
	‚Ä¢	Tool source (Black Duck / Checkmarx)
	‚Ä¢	Finding details (e.g., CWE ID, component, severity, description)
	‚Ä¢	Reason for exception (why remediation is not feasible)
	‚Ä¢	Proposed mitigation or compensating controls
	‚Ä¢	Proposed end date (based on severity)
	‚Ä¢	Attachments (e.g., screenshots, scan report, email approvals)

3Ô∏è‚É£ SSG Review
	‚Ä¢	ServiceNow automatically assigns the ticket (or creates an SCTASK) to the SSG queue.
	‚Ä¢	SSG reviews:
	‚Ä¢	Validates details & justification
	‚Ä¢	Adds recommendations and/or compensating controls
	‚Ä¢	Approves/rejects or routes to SG&R for final decision
	‚Ä¢	Adds comments and recommendations in a structured field (e.g., ‚ÄúSSG Recommendation‚Äù)

4Ô∏è‚É£ SG&R Final Approval
	‚Ä¢	SG&R reviews SSG‚Äôs recommendations.
	‚Ä¢	Either:
	‚Ä¢	Approves the exception ‚Üí sets approved until date (based on severity)
	‚Ä¢	Rejects the request ‚Üí sends back to application team with comments

5Ô∏è‚É£ Expiry Tracking
	‚Ä¢	Each exception must have an end date.
	‚Ä¢	ServiceNow sends automated notifications:
	‚Ä¢	15 days before expiry
	‚Ä¢	On the day of expiry
	‚Ä¢	Allows extension requests through a related ‚ÄúExtension Request‚Äù ticket or workflow.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Search & Reporting
	‚Ä¢	Tickets should be searchable by:
	‚Ä¢	Application name
	‚Ä¢	Ticket number
	‚Ä¢	Finding ID (e.g., Black Duck or Checkmarx ID)
	‚Ä¢	Ability to filter by status (Pending SSG, Pending SG&R, Approved, Expired, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Exportable reports (optional) showing active and expired exceptions.
